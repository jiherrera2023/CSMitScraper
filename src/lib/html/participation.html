<p>If you're thinking about which subjects to take and when to take them, the
tables below might be useful.</p>

<p>For each EECS major, you can see the subjects taken by those
majors, sorted with the most-taken subjects first.  For each subject,
you can also see the distribution of the year of the student when they
took the subject.</p>

<p>The counts come from the transcripts of current students and those who
received their SB after Fall 2014.</p>

We will seek to provide sufficient coverage of tutorial hours to satisfy the time zone constraints of participating students.  There will be no lab component of 6.002 this term.  In its place we will provide an expanded treatment of analysis and design methods to give students an especially strong foundation in circuits and electronics.  In a future term we plan to offer a separate 3-unit lab class that can be taken by those completing this term’s class.</p></div></a></td>

Bits module includes information, entropy, data compression algorithms, and error correction with block and convolutional codes. Signals module includes modeling physical channels and noise, signal design, filtering and detection, modulation, and frequency-division multiplexing. Packets module includes switching and queuing principles, media access control, routing protocols, and data transport protocols.</p><p>Lecturers:</p><div style="margin-top: 0; margin-left:1em;">Katrina L.

The current plan is to have some sort of “live” lecture during the scheduled time (MW2), but to offer at least one alternative time for students whose timezones prevent them from attending that time slot. There is a good chance that all lecture material (recordings, etc.) will be available online as well. The exact format of these lectures — a more traditional live lecture, or more of a flipped classroom model — is not yet decided.</p></div></a></td>

While “live” participation is encouraged, recordings of the lectures will be available for those not able to attend the sessions live, with means provided (e.g., via Piazza) for asynchronous responses to questions.  Students will be mailed/provided a full FPGA kit for the fall term that must be returned at the end of the semester.  Lab assignments will all be capable of being completed remotely using student computers, FPGAs, and additional circuit components provided in the kits.  We don't require a tablet computer for the course, however a computer that is capable of running Vivado (on either Windows or Linux or on Mac using a VM of Windows of Linux) will be needed. Feel free to email jodalyst@mit.edu with questions about details of the hardware and/or other options/plans. We expect to have the 6.111 lab space open for most of the day on weekdays at this point for on-campus students to use like a normal semester, however presence in the lab will not be required to do the lab assignments or the final project.
