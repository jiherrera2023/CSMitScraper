The first class will take place at the regularly scheduled default time (TR 2:30 pm).    However, a Doodle poll will be sent in late August to all students registered for credit to explore the possibility of alternate times for both the lectures and the optional weekly office hours that will maximize “live” participation. Since 6.161 is not being offered this term, there will be no access to the Modern Optics Lab.  PDFs of the class notes will be shared with all the registered students.  Homework will be assigned as usual. We will have 4 in-class, open-book mini-quizzes each 30 minutes long (simplified format) to gauge mastery of the fundamentals. The final project report is still a requirement.  A cell phone (or scanner) to image and e-mail your hand-written work will be helpful.

We  will run our evening laboratory, each Wednesday from 1900--2200  EDT (7:00PM--10:00PM).  We expect students to actively  participate in all of the meetings, so it may be difficult for  students who are in some time zones.  If a significant number of  students want the hours to be modified, we will be happy to  adjust, as appropriate, (one advantage of online teaching is that  there is not a problem with allocating a classroom!)  The times  can be renegotiated by the class in the first few meetings of the  term.<br>  <br>  We also invite students individually and in groups to drop in  (online) to discuss problems with us at other times.

Lynch &lt;lynch@csail.mit.edu&gt;</div><p>Offered: online.  6.852 (Distributed Algorithms) will consist of lectures, problem sets,   and term projects.  No exams.  All activities should be doable remotely.<br>  <br>  1.  Lectures:<br>  <br>  These will be held over Zoom.  We like interaction, so we think it   would be great if everyone could attend in person, at least most of   the time, and ask questions and offer comments.  However, for cases   where this is not feasible, we will record the Zoom sessions and post   the recordings on the course Stellar web site.  We will also post   Powerpoint lecture slides.<br>  <br>  We don't require lecture attendance, but we will encourage it by   having "class participation" count as part of a small "subjective"   component of the grade (which also includes other things such as   meeting with staff during office hours and helping with grading   problem sets).  If you cannot participate in lectures, participating   in other ways will be sufficient for you to score full points on   participation.<br>  <br>  2.  Problem sets:<br>  <br>  We encourage group discussion of key ideas for solving the problems,   though you must write up solutions on your own.  Thus, you might want   to join a problem set discussion group.  We will set up some kind of   sign-up mechanism to help you find others to work with.  You can meet   with your group however you like, in person or remotely.  Problem sets   will be submitted on-line, most likely using Gradescope.<br>  <br>  Teams of students will grade the pset problems, working under the   supervision of the course TAs.  This will all be done on-line.  Each   student will grade only a very few problems, for the entire class.<br>  <br>  3.  Term projects:<br>  <br>  A highlight of the course is the group term projects.  These can be   theoretical research, experimental research, or reading projects.  You   will have wide latitude in choosing projects (within the general scope   of distributed computing theory); we will suggest some possibilities   but these are only suggestions.<br>  <br>  You should work in groups of 2-4 students.  Again, we will help with a   mechanism to help you find others to work with, but then you can meet   with your group however you like.  Course projects will have suggested   "mentors" (a member of the staff or an outside person), who will meet   with the group using a mutually convenient method.<br>  <br>  4.  Office hours:<br>  <br>  The course instructor and the TAs will hold regular office hours, at a   variety of times that should accommodate students in different time   zones.  If no office hours are possible for you, we will work with you   to find additional times.  In general, the course staff will work with   you to find mutually acceptable meeting times.</p></div></a>, <a class="annotated-link" href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.853" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">6.853*<div class="annotation"><b>6.853 Topics in Algorithmic Game Theory</b><br><hr> <img src="https://eecsappsrv.mit.edu/images/grad.gif"> (<img src="https://eecsappsrv.mit.edu/images/spring.gif">)<br>Prereqs: 6.006 or 6.046<br>Units: 3-0-9<hr><p>Presents research topics at the interface of computer science and game theory, with an emphasis on algorithms and computational complexity.

While “live” participation is encouraged, recordings of the lectures will be available for those not able to attend the sessions live, with means provided (e.g., via Piazza) for asynchronous responses to questions.  Students will be mailed/provided a full FPGA kit for the fall term that must be returned at the end of the semester.  Lab assignments will all be capable of being completed remotely using student computers, FPGAs, and additional circuit components provided in the kits.  We don't require a tablet computer for the course, however a computer that is capable of running Vivado (on either Windows or Linux or on Mac using a VM of Windows of Linux) will be needed. Feel free to email jodalyst@mit.edu with questions about details of the hardware and/or other options/plans. We expect to have the 6.111 lab space open for most of the day on weekdays at this point for on-campus students to use like a normal semester, however presence in the lab will not be required to do the lab assignments or the final project. For final projects, if additional parts are needed, they can be mailed to students.</p></div></a></td>

  <br>
  <a name="AUS2" style="color:black;"><b>AUS2</b></a>: Advanced undergraduate subject.  Also see the <b>grad_AUS2</b> list below.
     A subject provides an AUS2 experience if at least 40% of the grade in a 12-unit
     subject is based on new advanced technical material that is rigorously evaluated
     through examinations, problem sets, projects or papers. Such subjects will ideally
     have a header-level subject (less ideally, a foundation-level subject) as a
     prerequisite; they may be dual-numbered with graduate subjects, but must have
     distinct requirements to ensure accessibility to the range of undergraduate
     students in the department.

Traditionally, humans develop new machine learning algorithms and learn topics by reading, watching videos, and taking courses. Meta learning or learning to learn, has allowed machines to learn to learn new algorithms; discover physics formulas or symbolic expressions that match data; develop systems for automatic model discovery; teach machines to read, learn and reason; ace science exams at the high school level; and solve the SAT. In this graduate level course students develop components of a program that participates in an undergraduate course as an AI. The course covers advanced deep learning topics used for&nbsp; learning to learn, including: automated machine learning, meta-learning, deep learning on graphs, transformers, knowledge graphs, symbolic regression, program induction, Bayesian learning, and deep reinforcement learning. The highlight of the course is participating in building a system that passes 6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning as a virtual student: teaching a machine how to learn machine learning. The system will solve very specialized tasks: learning 6.036 from course material: notes, exercises, exams, solutions, labs, etc., and will participate in 6.036 by solving exercises, quizzes, labs, exams, and ultimately pass the course as a virtual online student, or 6.036AI.</p><p>Lecturers:</p><div style="margin-top: 0; margin-left:1em;">Iddo Drori &lt;idrori@mit.edu&gt;</div><p>Offered: online.

While synchronous participation is strongly encouraged, recordings of the lectures will be available for those not able to attend the “live” sessions. The first class will take place at the regularly scheduled default time (TR 2:30 pm).    However, a Doodle poll will be sent in late August to all students registered for credit to explore the possibility of alternate times for both the lectures and the optional weekly office hours that will maximize “live” participation. Since 6.161 is not being offered this term, there will be no access to the Modern Optics Lab.  PDFs of the class notes will be shared with all the registered students.  Homework will be assigned as usual. We will have 4 in-class, open-book mini-quizzes each 30 minutes long (simplified format) to gauge mastery of the fundamentals. The final project report is still a requirement.  A cell phone (or scanner) to image and e-mail your hand-written work will be helpful.

All activities should be doable remotely.<br>  <br>  1.  Lectures:<br>  <br>  These will be held over Zoom.  We like interaction, so we think it   would be great if everyone could attend in person, at least most of   the time, and ask questions and offer comments.  However, for cases   where this is not feasible, we will record the Zoom sessions and post   the recordings on the course Stellar web site.  We will also post   Powerpoint lecture slides.<br>  <br>  We don't require lecture attendance, but we will encourage it by   having "class participation" count as part of a small "subjective"   component of the grade (which also includes other things such as   meeting with staff during office hours and helping with grading   problem sets).  If you cannot participate in lectures, participating   in other ways will be sufficient for you to score full points on   participation.<br>  <br>  2.  Problem sets:<br>  <br>  We encourage group discussion of key ideas for solving the problems,   though you must write up solutions on your own.  Thus, you might want   to join a problem set discussion group.  We will set up some kind of   sign-up mechanism to help you find others to work with.  You can meet   with your group however you like, in person or remotely.  Problem sets   will be submitted on-line, most likely using Gradescope.<br>  <br>  Teams of students will grade the pset problems, working under the   supervision of the course TAs.  This will all be done on-line.  Each   student will grade only a very few problems, for the entire class.<br>  <br>  3.  Term projects:<br>  <br>  A highlight of the course is the group term projects.  These can be   theoretical research, experimental research, or reading projects.  You   will have wide latitude in choosing projects (within the general scope   of distributed computing theory); we will suggest some possibilities   but these are only suggestions.<br>  <br>  You should work in groups of 2-4 students.  Again, we will help with a   mechanism to help you find others to work with, but then you can meet   with your group however you like.

However, a Doodle poll will be sent in late August to all students registered for credit to explore the possibility of alternate times for both the lectures and the optional weekly office hours that will maximize “live” participation. Since 6.161 is not being offered this term, there will be no access to the Modern Optics Lab.  PDFs of the class notes will be shared with all the registered students.

All activities should be doable remotely.<br>  <br>  1.  Lectures:<br>  <br>  These will be held over Zoom.  We like interaction, so we think it   would be great if everyone could attend in person, at least most of   the time, and ask questions and offer comments.  However, for cases   where this is not feasible, we will record the Zoom sessions and post   the recordings on the course Stellar web site.  We will also post   Powerpoint lecture slides.<br>  <br>  We don't require lecture attendance, but we will encourage it by   having "class participation" count as part of a small "subjective"   component of the grade (which also includes other things such as   meeting with staff during office hours and helping with grading   problem sets).  If you cannot participate in lectures, participating   in other ways will be sufficient for you to score full points on   participation.<br>  <br>  2.  Problem sets:<br>  <br>  We encourage group discussion of key ideas for solving the problems,   though you must write up solutions on your own.  Thus, you might want   to join a problem set discussion group.  We will set up some kind of   sign-up mechanism to help you find others to work with.

Again, we will help with a   mechanism to help you find others to work with, but then you can meet   with your group however you like.  Course projects will have suggested   "mentors" (a member of the staff or an outside person), who will meet   with the group using a mutually convenient method.<br>  <br>  4.  Office hours:<br>  <br>  The course instructor and the TAs will hold regular office hours, at a   variety of times that should accommodate students in different time   zones.  If no office hours are possible for you, we will work with you   to find additional times.  In general, the course staff will work with   you to find mutually acceptable meeting times.</p></div></a>, <a class="annotated-link" href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.853" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">6.853<div class="annotation"><b>6.853 Topics in Algorithmic Game Theory</b><br><hr> <img src="https://eecsappsrv.mit.edu/images/grad.gif"> (<img src="https://eecsappsrv.mit.edu/images/spring.gif">)<br>Prereqs: 6.006 or 6.046<br>Units: 3-0-9<hr><p>Presents research topics at the interface of computer science and game theory, with an emphasis on algorithms and computational complexity.

The class revolves around independent term projects sponsored by leaders in the sports industry, and will be in the format of online synchronous (TR 1-2.30pm). These projects are executed by small teams of students, mixing undergrads, grads and business school students. At least one of the two classes will be independent team working sessions to advance the project, mentored by one of the instructors. The working sessions require all the team members to be present while they are happening, since they consist of technical/strategic/communication discussions around the status of each team’s specific project. In addition of the work sessions, we will host a variety of workshops (data analysis, leadership, written and oral communication) that will be recorded, but they will also require active participation from the students. We will also have seminars by leaders in the field to discuss industries and innovation opportunities within sports technology, and these will be in the form of informal conversations and Q&amp;A to make the experience as interactive as possible.
